Usenti is:
- an 8bit bitmap editor for Windows with nearly all the capabitities 
  of MS-Paint, plus a few extras like proper palette editor,
  adjustable grid settings for easy tile-aligning and mouse-wheel 
  use for zooming and moving aruond the image.
- using standard Windows-interface functionality like undo, toolbars, 
  profile-settings, drag&drop and clipboard support.
- capable of exporting to GBA source code (C/S/BIN/GBFS).
- able to do some advanced (*cough*yeah right*cough*) palette 
  remapping like swapping and sorting.

Usenti is NOT:
- a photo-editor. You're not supposed to edit photos at the pixel-
  level. You can try, of course, but I give no guarantees.
- expensive. In fact, it's absolutely free :).
- restricted to 8bit bitmaps. Though internally working with an
  8bit palette, images at other bitdepths can be used as well, although
  true-color images will be quantized to 256 colors.

Usenti's primary purpose:
  To create/modify simple graphics where editing is done by the 
  pixel and easy control over the palette is essential. And we all
  know how woefully inadequate MS-Paint is there.
  Initially intended specifically for GBA graphics, it should work
  fine for other purposes (like web-graphics) as well.

Platforms:
  Win32.

Usable image formats:
  BMP, PCX, PNG, TGA

Last changes:
- (1.7.9): Exporter upgrade to grit 0.8.1.
- (1.7.9): Requantize option.
- (1.7.9): Shift+Fill replaces all colors of the selected pixel.
- (1.7.8): Font exporter and changes to texttool for easy bitmap-font making.
- (1.7.8): Different paste modes.
