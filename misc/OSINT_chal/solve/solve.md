## OSINT Challenge
The challenge description is pretty vague, but mentions that the person of interest has been making posts under the hashtag "#shrive".

Searching for this hashtag on Twitter, you can find that the only posts made with this hashtag in the past month have been by the account [@V760DHM.](https://twitter.com/V760DHM)

There's a lot of useless and irrelevant information on their profile. Their very first tweet, however, is an [imgur link](https://imgur.com/gallery/rdZ9RBz) - the "other account" asked for in the challenge description. Clicking on the imgur image and then the "v760dhm" account name will lead you to their gallery, which has one other image. The flag is hidden in a downvoted comment on this image.
