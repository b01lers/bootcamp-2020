## HTML Comment
This challenge is intended to help you get familiarized with the various developer tools available in browsers. The flag is split up into five parts. Opening up the browser developer tools, you can find the following.

Part 1: Comment in index.html: `<!-- (1/5): flag{ -->`
Part 2: Error in the console:  `(2/5): w3lc`
Part 3: Comment in the CSS stylesheet: `/* (3/5): 0m3_ */`
Part 4: Comment in script.js: `// (4/5): t0_E`
Part 5: Key in local storage: `(5/5) | NC0M}`

Assembling the five parts together, you get the flag:
flag{w3lc0m3_t0_ENC0M}
