The server is stateless so it believes whatever the user sends. The state string has a format 
"location,(challenge_levels)", e.g., "3,(0,0,.....0)" is the value upon landing. Changing
3->9 moves the player to the tower. Once there, you need to still display the challenge
somehow (normally descriptions are only generated on move commands). But you can issue
"RESET", get the challenge displayed, solve and submit it, and get the flag.

You can simply loop through numbers 1, 2, 3.... until you get the right hash (e.g., 5663566 works).

ANSWER: 5663566 (or any other number that hashes correctly)

As a one-liner with curl:

curl "localhost:5000/api?token=secret&state=9,(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)&comm=ans%205663566"

(you need to substitute your token for 'secret', of course)
